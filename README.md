# Challonger

A Slack bot that will run tournaments via [Challonge.com](Challonge.com)


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. ~~See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.~~


### Prerequisities

This is a [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/) project. You can either download it from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/) or use one of the following below


#### Mac
If you're using the excellent homebrew package manager, you can install node with one command: `brew install node`.

If not, follow the below steps:
* [Install Xcode](http://developer.apple.com/technologies/tools/)
* [Install git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/)
* Run commands below

```
git clone git://github.com/ry/node.git
cd node
./configure
make
sudo make install
```

#### Debian (Ubuntu/ Mint)
With Aptitude package manager one can install the package nodeJS then edit there bash to redirect the command node to nodejs.
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install nodejs
sudo apt-get install npm
```

#### Redhat (Fedora / CentOs)
```sudo yum install nodejs npm```

#### Windows
Currently, you must use [cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com/) to install node. To do so, follow these steps:
* Install cygwin.
* Open the cygwin command line with Start > Cygwin > Cygwin Bash Shell.
* Run the below commands to download and build node.
```
git clone git://github.com/ry/node.git

## Installation

Clone the repo. Change directory to the root of the bot files. Download all the dependencies.

Change `auth.json.example` to `auth.json`

Enter the credentials needed in `auth.json`

Run the bot
